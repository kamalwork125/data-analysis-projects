- ###6# 🛒 E-commerce Sales Analysis (Python Project)
 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a simulated E-commerce sales dataset using Python. The dataset includes customer purchases, product details, delivery performance, and ratings. The goal is to uncover business insights such as top-performing products, delivery trends, customer satisfaction, and city-wise revenue
## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Filled nulls in numeric columns (`Price Each`, `Customer Rating`) with mean/median.
- Filled missing product names with `"Unknown Product"`.
- Converted `Order Date` to datetime.
- Added a new column: `Sales = Quantity Ordered × Price Each`.
 📊 Key Analysis Performed
 ✅ 1. Top-Selling Product Categories
- Found categories with the highest total revenue using groupby and barplot.
 ✅ 2. Average Delivery Time by City
- Calculated average delivery days for each city to evaluate logistics performance.
 ✅ 3. Top 5 Rated Products
- Identified products with highest average customer ratings.
 ✅ 4. City-wise Revenue
- Found which cities brought in the most revenue.
 ✅ 5. Correlation Analysis
- Checked relationship between `Quantity Ordered` and `Customer Rating`.
 📈 Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** or VS Code for development
 📌 Sample Visuals

- Bar charts for revenue by city and category
- Horizontal bar plot for top-rated products
- Line plot for monthly sales
- Heatmap for correlation
 📘 Conclusion
- Most sales came from [Top Category] and [Top City].
- Delivery performance varied across cities.
- Customer satisfaction was higher for [Top Products].
- Null values were handled effectively before analysis.
